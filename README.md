Welcome to Common Cents , an expense tracker app thats built for the everyday user , designed to be simple and easy to use , yet providing multiple functionality to make tracking your finances a breeze.

### Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

## Current Functional Specification
The webpage consist of 3 main components:
1.Register User / Login In

*Each will be further elaborated with images below*

### 1. Register User / Login User

The Registration and Login Page is built with React-Bootstrap, both functionalities are on the same page , using Tabs to render the different functionalities. This is the first time i am using this React-Bootstrap Components and i am definitely loving it.

### 2. Add , View ,Edit , Delete  Entries

Using Card components to build out the interface and placing them in Containers to maintain the structure.  

## Current state of App
### Front End
Currently the Front-end is not complete, what you are seeing is hardcoded values. 
Personally, i have much to improve on the design on the app and the features list , below i will explain future functionalities for this app.

### Backend 
Backend has always been something that i am generally weaker in , but im proud to say that the backend is fully functional , from Schemas built to API endpoints to the Controllers to fetch and manipulate the data. Having tested all endpoint with Insomnia(similar to API testing app "Postman").


## Future Improvements to App
As the app is not complete i intend to continue working on it and implement more features into it such as:

1. Through the use of Lodash to manipulate the data (e.g _.sortby , ._filter) to manipulate the data and provide more functionality.
2. Functions like filter by categories or displaying graphs and charts through D3js to provide visuals for users to track their finances
3. Adding features like calenders to visualize and note down dates of expeditures or income.


## Reflection
Through building this app , i am able to see the gaps in my knowledge and have noted them down , i aim to work on them and close up these gaps and with that continue to improve on this app. Although feeling abit upset at first at not being able to finish within the stipulated timeline, i feel proud knowing that 6 months ago all this would not have been possible and i know that 6 months from now , alot more will be possible. 


Thank you and stay tuned for the final product.
